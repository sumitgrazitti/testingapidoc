## ISSUE: No Way to Exclude Documents from Search {or How to remove documents from the index}
You can exclude one or two documents from search, or make an entire category of documents invisible to searchers.

### METHOD 1. Exclude One or Two Docs from Search
The simplest way to exclude a few documents from search is to delete them from a search engine's index. 
1. Go to **Content Sources** > **Total Documents**.
2. Select your search client from the dropdown.
3. Use the search box to find a document. 

### METHOD 2. Make Entire Doc Category (or Categories) Unsearchable
This process involves excluding documents that have either a specified content field value (authorName) or fall within a specified content field range (date).  
1. Go to **Search Clients** > ![EDIT](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Resources-Mamba20/Images/Icons/edit-tuning.png) > **Content Sources** > **Create Formula**. 
2. Find a content field. It can be ```date```, ```url```, ```authorName```, or anything. Mention a value for the content field and toggle **Parity** to the right. All documents with that content field value will disappear from search. For example, if you set ```firstName``` to ```/chetan/i```, then all the documents written by authors whose first name is "Chetan" will become unsearchable.
