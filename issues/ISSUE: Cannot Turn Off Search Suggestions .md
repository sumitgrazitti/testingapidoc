## ISSUE: Cannot Turn Off Search Suggestions 
> **IMPORTANT**. Search suggestions cannot be turned off entirely for a search client.

Search suggestions help users find information quicker. Although they cannot be turned off entirely, you can prevent them from displaying for specific keywords. The process is straightforward.

1. Go to **NLP Manager** > **Suggestions Removal**.
2. Select a search client.
3. Click **Add Text**.
4. Enter the keyword(s) and click **Save.**

Search suggestions will not be displayed for the keyword(s) on the selected search engine.
